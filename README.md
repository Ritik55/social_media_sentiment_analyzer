# Social Media Sentiment Analyzer

## Overview
This project is a powerful tool for analyzing sentiment from social media posts about specific topics or brands. It collects data from Twitter and Reddit, processes the text, performs sentiment analysis, and visualizes the results through an interactive dashboard.

## Features
- Data collection from Twitter and Reddit using their respective APIs
- Text preprocessing and cleaning
- Sentiment classification using machine learning
- Interactive web dashboard for sentiment visualization

## Technologies Used
- Python 3.8+
- Flask for backend web development
- NLTK for natural language processing
- scikit-learn for machine learning
- Tweepy for Twitter API integration
- PRAW for Reddit API integration
- Plotly for interactive visualizations

## Setup and Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/social-media-sentiment-analyzer.git
   cd social-media-sentiment-analyzer
   ```

2. Install required packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Set up API keys:
   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory
   - Add your API keys and tokens:
